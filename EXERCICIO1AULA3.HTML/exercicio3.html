     Are you aching for the blade?<br>
     That's okay<br>
     We're insured<br>
     Are you aching for the grave?<br>
     That's okay<br>
     We're insured<br>
     <br>
     We're getting away with it<br>
     All messed up<br>
     Getting away with it<br>
     All messed up<br>
     That's the living<br>
     <br>
     Daniel's saving Grace<br>
     She's out in deep water<br>
     Hope he's a good swimmer<br>
     <br>
     Daniel plays his ace<br>
     Deep inside his temple<br>
     He knows how to surf her<br>
     <br>
     We're getting away with it<br>
     All messed up<br>
     Getting away with it<br>
     All messed up<br>
     That's the living<br>
     <br>
     Daniel drinks his weight<br>
     Drinks like Richard Burton<br>
     Dance like John Travolta, now<br>
     <br>
     Daniel's saving Grace<br>
     He was all but drowning<br>
     Now they live like dolphins<br>
     <br>
     Getting away with it<br>
     All messed up<br>
     Getting away with it<br>
     All messed up<br>
     That's the living<br>
     Getting away with it<br>
     Getting away with it<br>
     Getting away with it<br>
     That's the living<br>
     That's the living<br>
